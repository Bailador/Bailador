## Versioning model

The Baildor repository holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime :

 - Main branch :

 We consider `origin/main` to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.

 - Dev branch :

 We consider `origin/dev` to be the branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.

When the source code in the `dev` branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes are merged back into `main` and then tagged with a release number.
