# Bailador

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ufobat/Bailador.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ufobat/Bailador) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ufobat/Bailador?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ufobat/Bailador/branch/master)

A light-weight route-based web application framework for Perl 6

## Example

```Perl6
use Bailador;
    
# simple cases
get '/' => sub {
    "hello world"
}
    
baile;
```

For more examples, pleasee see the [examples](examples) folder.

## Exported subs


Subroutines for your Application
--------------------------------

### `get(Pair $x)`
### `post(Pair $x)`
### `put(Pair $x)`
### `delete(Pair $x)`

Addes A Route for get, post, put or delete requests.

### `renderer(Bailador::Template $renderer)`

Sets the Renderer that's being used to render your templates. See the Template section for more details.

### `sessions-config()`

Returns the Sessions-config. You can influence how sessions work. See the Sessions section for details.

### `baile()`

Lets enter the dance floor. ¡Olé!

Subroutines that sould only be used inside the Code block of a Route
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### `content_type(Str $type)`

Sets the Content Type for the response to $type.

### `request()`

Gets current the Request.

### `header(Str $name, Cool $value)`

Adds a Header to the Repsonse.

### `cookie(Str $name, Str $value, Str :$domain, Str :$path, DateTime :$expires, Bool :$http-only; Bool :$secure)`

Adds a Cookie to the response.

### `status(Int $code)`

Sets the status code of a response.

### `template(Str $template-name, *@params)`

Calls the template which is a file in the views folder. For more details see the Template section. Should only be used within the code block of a route.

### `session()`

Returns the Session Hash. Session Hashes are empty if you start a new session. For details see the Sessions section.

## Routing

Routes are easily created with a subroutine that is called like the HTTP method you want to use followed by a code block or anything that is "Callable".
The return value of the code block or Callable is content of the response that's been sent back to the browser. If you want to send cookies or headers use

    cookie()
    header()
    
as described in the methods above.

## Templates

Currently there are 2 different engines supported out of the box: Template::Mojo and Template::Mustache.
Where Template::Mojo is the default engine but if you want to switch to Template::Mustache you just call

    renderer(Bailador::Template::Mustache.new);

It is possible to user other template engines as well.
Therefore you need to create a class that implements the role Bailador::Template. Its basically just required to implement the render method.

The template files should be placed in a folder named "views" which is located in the same directory as your application.pl file. When you call the subroutine

    template 'template.tt', $name, $something;
    
the template (or in other words the file views/template.tt) gets invoked "as a subroutine" and the @params get passed. This is a example of a template file with Template::Mojo:

    % my ($name, $something) = @_;
    <html ... codes goes here ...>
        <h1><% $name %></h1>
    <html>

    
## Sessions

Sessions are implemented using a Session Cookie. If the browser rejects cookies, Bailador is not able to handle sessions.

In order to create a session just call the subroutine

    session()
    
inside the code block of a route. This subroutine returns a Hash in which you can just toss in all data or objects that should be be in the session context.
After your route code is finished the session will be stored automatically. How this should be done can be configured.
The handling of sessions can be influencend if you call

    sessions-config()
    
inside the bailador script before you call baile. As soon as you have requested the first session it is of no use to change the configure any further.
Following config options are available. Most of them should be self explaining.

* cookie-name = 'bailador';
* cookie-path = '/';
* cookie-expiration = 3600;
* hmac-key = 'changeme';
* backend = "Bailador::Sessions::Store::Memory";

The Session-ID contains a HMAC to check if someone's trying to guess a Session-ID in order to hijack a session. This case it will create a warning which is printed to standard error.

The Session Data itself is stored by default in the memory, if you want to store the data on the disk or database of wherever, just implement a class which does the role Bailador::Sessions::Store
and set backend to this class name.
